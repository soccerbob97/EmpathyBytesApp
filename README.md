# EmpathyBytesApp
Empathy Bytes is a Georgia Tech VIP project that aims to create a digital archive of a Georgia Tech community of choice.
For the Spring 2021 and Fall 2021 semester, our community of choice was the maker space communities. Members of the Empathy Bytes VIP team interviewed those 
from the Invention Studio and The Hive makerspaces, and those interviews are included in the app last semester. This semester's main focus was to create an
AR makerspace gallery where users can learn about the products students has made in the makerspace by seeing descriptions of the object and
the object in their environment using AR. This promotes empathy because users understand what can be accomplished in the makerspace by looking 
at the finished products in their environment through AR.
